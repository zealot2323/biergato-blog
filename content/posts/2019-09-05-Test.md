With my recent fascination with kveik yeast, I wanted to try making a gose, pitching both the kveik and lactobacillus yeast at the same time. Since most kveik strains can tolerate the same pitching temperatures as lactobacillus (95°f ish), it seemed like a way to turn a beer around a few days quicker. Plus, kveik can ferment out in just a few days which lines up well with how long it takes to sour a beer with lacto. 

For this beer, I didn't have a chance to make it to the brewing store and only had 2-row on had so I made a trip to whole foods and got millet and unmalted wheat to make this recipe closer to a traditional gose recipe.

### Process

Since there was unmodified malt in the recipe, I performed a cereal mash with the millet, boiling it for 10 minutes.  Once the cereal mash was done, I added the entire contents into my mash. For the wheat, I just threw it in with the normal mash. The beer I chose to only bring up to pasteurization temperatures to make for a quicker brew day. I held it at those temps for 10 minutes then cooled it off to 95°f and transferred to the keg. I added both the Good Belly Pure Shot and a small portion of Voss Kveik from Omega. I oxygenated as normal. 

Within 5 hours, the kveik yeast was chugging along and within 2 days, it had finished out at 1.007. The pH had dropped to 3.36 in the same time. I let the beer finish off at 98 for 2 days then cooled it down and transferred to a serving keg to carbonate. 

### Tasting Notes

Appearance - Light gold with some haze. Surprisingly clear given the amount of wheat and millet.  Rocky head that fades but still better than most sour's I've done, probably on account of the millet. 

Aroma - Citrus and orange peel up front with some other nondescript fruit underneath. Light acidic smell. Some doughy malt aroma. 

Taste - Orange and lemon flavors upfront with floral and tropical notes on the finish. Firm saltiness that makes this very thirst quenching. Some doughy notes but mostly yeast and spice forward. 

Mouthfeel - Medium to high carbonation with a dry finish. Somewhat creamy, may be on account of the kveik yeast or millet. 

Overall - A really delightful summer beer. For something that was grain to glass in a week, I'm definitely impressed at the depth of the beer. Would like to try upping the millet next time and experiment with different kveik strains to see if I can get more fruit esters from any of them (although Voss is noted as one of the more fruit forward strains.)
