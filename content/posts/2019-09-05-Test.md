With a year of travel coming up, I'll shift the focus of this blog to my ramblings and the beers I find there. Expect in-depth looks into the fermentation scene at my destinations, any interesting beers being brewed there and any fun developments on fermentation experiments abroad. I'll continue brewing when I can and plan to leave a few beers fermenting at friend's house's around the country (more on those soon!).
