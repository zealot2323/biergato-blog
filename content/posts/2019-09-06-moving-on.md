With a year of travel coming up, I'll shift the focus of this blog to focus on the fermented foods and beverages I find abroad. Expect in-depth looks into the fermentation scene at my destinations, any interesting beers being brewed there and any fun developments on my fermentation experiments abroad. I'll continue brewing when I can and plan to leave a few beers fermenting at friend's house's around the country (more on those soon!). Long form posts will be on this site, for short form and photos of my travels check out my instagram [@biergato](https://www.instagram.com/biergato/).
