It's been awhile since I've brewed anything with all of the travel. Since the shelter in place orders started, our travel has stopped and we've returned to the USA. With all the spare time, I've started a number of other fermentation projects including some beer. 

I returned to a much simpler setup since I didn't want to dig out my entire setup from storage. This is the first time I've brewed on a stovetop since probably 2014!

The recipe was based on the [Kinda Classic Saison](https://beerandbrewing.com/suarez-family-brewery-kinda-classic-a-modern-saison-recipe/) from Suarez Family Brewery. I've never actually had this beer but have lots of great things about it and wanted to give it a shot since I liked the sound of a simple recipe. With such a simple recipe, I chose to use an expressive pale malt varietal from the local maltery, Admiral Malting called [Feldblume](https://admiralmaltings.com/malt/feldblume/). It's described as: "A light golden malt with floral aromas of clover and hay and a mild scone-like sweetness." Sounded perfect for a saison! 

With the quarantine in full swing, some of the hops for the recipe were out of stock so I made some subsitutes with similar hops. For the Celeia hops, I went with Slovenian Savinjski Golding hops which I haven't used before but sounded like a similar parentage. 

The yeast I did a blend of Safale BE-134 Belgian Ale yeast since I haven't used it before and Mainiacal Yeast Marina which is a Russian farmhouse yeast. The Marina yeast is a product of Lars Marius Garshol's hunt for farmhouse yeast around Europe. This particular strain is from Marina Fyodorovna in Russia and has characteristics described as: "deep earthy tones with light notes of stone fruit and hay. It also has a touch of citrus peel character to it."  More info about the strain and how it was originally used could be found [here](http://www.garshol.priv.no/blog/399.html). I've enjoyed all of the Mainiacal yeasts I've used in the path and appreciate having access to such obscure farmhouse strains from around the world. 

I brewed a pretty small batch, 1.5 gallons, because I only had a small 2 gallon pot to work with. I ordered ingredients from More Beer and had it shipped to my house, having them mill the grains. Probably wasn't the best crush for BIAB but I made it work. Efficiency did tank but I sparged to try to compensate for it and got back closer to the OG but was still about .05 gravity points off. It was great having such a quick cleanup and cooldown and definitely makes me think about what I would want in my next setup. 

The fermentation was quick, potentially as a result of the Marina yeast, finishing in about 4 days including rests. I bottled a paultry 8 bottles but it was nice having such a quick packaging step.
